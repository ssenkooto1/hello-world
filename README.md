This is a Portfolio that works as a presentation card for a Software developer, showcasing some important projects, personal and contact info, while keeping a fresh and elegant web design. 

## Built With

### Prerequisites
There's no installation required.  One suggestion is to have a Text Editor with a plugin to easily deploy the project (Like Live Server in VSCode) while modifying it.

If you want to run Linter checks locally, it's another story. You need to make sure to have installed the latest version of Node.js and npm on your computer.

If you want to set up a personal repository based on this one, you can as well fork it.
