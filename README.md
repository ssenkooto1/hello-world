# Linters

> This is the first Microverse Hello World project prepared for day 2, where we look at the how to use Linter with the basics of html and css. 


This works to test our understanding of linter so that to provide error free code. 

## Built With

- HTML/CSS
- Visual Studio Code, Chrome Developer Tools


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- Clone this repository with git clone```https://github.com/ssenkooto1/hello-world.git``` using your terminal or command line.
- Change to the project directory by entering : <br>
```cd hello-world``` in the terminal

### Prerequisites
There's no installation required.  One suggestion is to have a Text Editor with a plugin to easily deploy the project (Like Live Server in VSCode) while modifying it.

If you want to run Linter checks locally, it's another story. You need to make sure to have installed the latest version of Node.js and npm on your computer.

### Setup
You can clone this repository or simply download the files as a .zip
If you want to set up a personal repository based on this one, you can as well fork it.

### Install
Only if you want to run Linter checks locally.
